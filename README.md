Although there were a couple of areas that needed to be improved, but the overall chart seems to be appropriate with the dataset provided. The above makeover plot contains all the modifications that were applied to make the story telling more efficient and logical.
* The gridlines were removed on both x- and y-axis because y axis already had scales to understand different price values. Moreover, as per my understanding, adding annotations provide context and help the reader and audience with some insights.
* 2019 and 2020 lines were modified from dash-lines to solid lines for two reasons â€“ first, here in this plot, each line is representing the actual value of the home prices and, secondly, in order to avoid confusions in audience, I kept all lines as solid. 2021 line were modified to be more prominent in terms of size and color.
* Legends were removed from the original chart and texts were added at the end of each line as it specifies more clear and precise information of a particular datapoint. 
* Different colors were used for different lines and texts in order to convey additional information related to the data. For example, red color was applied to the highest average value and seagreen color for the lowest price of homes. These modifications were applied so that it might help the lay audience understand the story
